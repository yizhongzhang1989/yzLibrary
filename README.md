yzLibrary 
===================
Author: Yizhong Zhang

A header only library for easy developing graphics demos. I know nothing about lisence, but anyone can use this library.

To use the library, all you need to do is to #include "yzLib/yz_lib.h" after all other necessary includes

I originally write yzLibrary to ease the labor of developing small demos for computer graphics. I found it really discusting to set dependencies every time I start a new project. It is even more descouraging to compile other people's code with a lot of third party libraries, even if these libraries are not necessary. So I write my own header only library.
